# Decking Planner

This project allows you to predict how many decking boards would be required for a decking area. It does not take into account the underlying joists or an edge. All measurements are in millimeters, but I suppose you could think of them as whatever unit of measurement you prefer.

## Development

* Run `npm install gulp` upon first downloading the repository.
* Make changes in the `/src` directory and run `gulp` to build `/dist/js/script.js` or run `gulp watch` to have it build each time a file is updated in the `/src` directory.
